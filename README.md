Software Defect Density Prediction involves estimating the number of defects or bugs in a software program relative to its size, typically measured in terms of lines of code (LOC) or function points. The goal of predicting defect density is to assess the quality of software and to prioritize areas of the software that might need more thorough testing or review. This prediction helps in managing and planning the software development and maintenance processes more effectively
